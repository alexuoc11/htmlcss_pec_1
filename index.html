                <strong>In a very short period of time, NFTs have shaken up the art market and generated a financial bubble. The use of blockchain technology overcomes an old problem for net art, but also brings with it new controversies such as its environmental impact.

                    Collins Dictionary recently announced that it has chosen the acronym NFT as its word of the year 2021. True to its role, Collins provides a concise definition of this term that has had such an impact on the contemporary art market in recent months: non- fungible token: a unique digital certificate, registered in a blockchain, that is used to record ownership of an asset such as an artwork or a collectible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among the many ways in which NFTs have been described, the definition given by Collins has the value of clarifying a fact that has often led to confusion: an <strong>NFT is a certificate</strong>, not a type of artwork, nor a creative technique, nor an art movement. Just because something is minted on a blockchain as a non-fungible token does not make it a work of art, or even a work of digital art. NFTs do not really represent a transformation in the way artworks are created, nor do they embody a particular conceptual or aesthetic premise. It is not a technology that, in itself, provides artists with new means of expression or defines a visual style. Non-fungible tokens make it possible to certify the authenticity and ownership of a work of art in digital format (among other things), which is by nature infinitely reproducible, and this is their great contribution to the way in which some contemporary art is distributed, marketed and collected today.

                    Having clarified what an NFT is, one might wonder how a simple digital certificate could generate so much media buzz, disrupt the art market and fuel a financial bubble in barely eight months. It is a complex, multi-layered and nuanced story that does not lend itself to a simple explanation, let alone a complete one.

            <h3>NFTs resolve a problem present since the inception of net art</h3>

                    When, in the mid-90s, a small group of artists began to experiment with the resources offered by the World Wide Web and HTML code, they saw the possibility of freely disseminating their works without having to depend on curators or gallery owners. In 1998, the artist Olia Lialina had the idea of turning her website into an art gallery and sold one of her works to the artists Michael Samyn and Auriea Harvey, who received the files and posted them on their own website, in a section entitled Possession. The work was still publicly accessible, but now had other owners. However, not all digital art can be sold in this way, which has led many artists, including Mark Napier [1], Carlo Zanni [2] and Rafael Rozendaal [3], to consider how to market their work on the internet. The main problem has always been how to ensure the collector’s ownership of a piece whose very nature is to be distributed and accessible to everyone.

                    The creation of Bitcoin in 2009 brought with it blockchain technology as a distributed and unalterable record – a resource that is particularly interesting for the art market, where the creation of value springs basically from the authenticity and scarcity of works of art. Starting in 2014, the first platforms were created that allow artists and creators to register intellectual property on a blockchain.
