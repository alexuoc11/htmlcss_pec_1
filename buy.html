                <p>Axie Infinity is a gaming metaverse where users can create and breed pets called Axies and compete with one another in a card game. Each Axie is a <b>unique digital asset</b> with unique traits and can be bought or sold.</p>
                <p>Axie Infinity is built on the Ethereum blockchain and requires a MetaMask wallet. It uses a pay-to-play-to-earn model where you can earn and cash out tokens (AXS or SLP) fortnightly as a reward.

                <p>Rarible is another leading NFT marketplace for tokenized digital art. To sign up on the platform,<b>you must have an Ethereum wallet</b>. Rarible hosts a variety of NFT categories, including photography, music, digital art, domains, metaverses, and games. Perhaps the best aspect about this platform is that <b>you can earn royalties on the NFTs you resell</b>, which means you can create a stream of passive income and receive a cut every time the NFT gets sold.</p>
                <p>Like most other marketplaces, Rarible <b>takes a 5% cut on every sale and splits it equally between the buyer and the seller</b>. That means both parties have to pay 2.5% of the final price.</p>

                <p>SuperRare is a <b>peer-to-peer digital art market that connects artists and collectors</b>. However, it is still in its early stages and so far, has only brought a handful of artists on board. SuperRare is unique in the sense that it is exclusive to only those artists who meet its criteria.</p>
                <p>SuperRare only accepts payments in ETH and requires users to have a MetaMask wallet. You’ll have to pay whatever the gas fee of the Ethereum network is at the time of buying. <b>It takes a 15% cut from the seller on every sale</b>, but also provides a 10% royalty each time the asset changes hands in the market. It also charges the buyer 3% of the NFT’s final price.</p>

                <p>Like other NFT marketplaces, Mintable takes a cut on every sold item. But this cut isn’t a flat fee. Instead, Mintable charges 2.5%, 5%, and 10% for normal, gasless, and printable NFTs, respectively.</p>
